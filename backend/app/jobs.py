"""Scheduled work.

Run these from the system's own scheduler rather than in-process:

    uv run python -m app.jobs escalate     # hourly
    uv run python -m app.jobs check        # daily
    uv run python -m app.jobs prune        # daily
    uv run python -m app.jobs all

They are written to be safe to run more than once and safe to interrupt: each
report is claimed by an insert that a unique constraint arbitrates, so two
overlapping runs cannot both send the same letter. What they are not safe
against is being run as an in-process loop under several web workers, which is
why there is no scheduler here.
