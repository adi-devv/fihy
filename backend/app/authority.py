"""Raising a confirmed report with the body responsible for it.

Two separate things, both swappable, both no-ops until configured:

  * a *drafter* turns a report and what people said about it into a letter;
  * a *channel* delivers that letter somewhere and can be asked about it later.

They are split because they fail differently. A drafter that is not configured
means no letter and nothing happens. A channel that is not configured means the
letter exists, is stored, and is readable by a person - but nothing is claimed
to have been sent, and the report's status does not move. Saying a complaint
reached a municipal body when it did not is the one failure this file exists to
avoid.
