"""What comes back.

An emailed complaint has nothing to poll, so the reply arrives here instead:
the mail provider posts it, the reply address says which report it belongs to,
and the reader decides whether it moves the report along.

Anything unrecognised is still stored. A reply nobody can classify is still a
reply the person who filed the complaint should get to read.
